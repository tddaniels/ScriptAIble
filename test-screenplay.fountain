FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A busy coffee shop with the morning rush. JANE (25), nervous and checking her phone repeatedly, sits at a corner table.

JANE enters, looking around nervously.

The BARISTA (22), friendly but tired, works behind the counter.

                    JANE
               (to herself)
    Where is he? He said ten o'clock.

JANE looks at her phone again. 10:15 AM.

                    JANE (CONT'D)
               (sighing)
    Maybe I should just go.

The door chimes. MARK (28), rushed and apologetic, enters.

                    MARK
               (out of breath)
    Jane! I'm so sorry. Traffic was insane.

                    JANE
               (relieved)
    I thought you weren't coming.

                    MARK
    Never. I've been looking forward to this.

They smile at each other.

                    BARISTA
               (calling out)
    Large coffee for Jane!

                    JANE
    That's me.

She gets up to collect her coffee.

                    MARK
               (to Barista)
    Make that two, please.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME TIME - CONTINUOUS

Jane returns with two coffees.

                    JANE
    So, about that script idea...

                    MARK
               (excited)
    Yes! I've been thinking about it all week.

FADE OUT.
