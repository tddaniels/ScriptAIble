INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The morning rush hour crowd fills every seat. Steam rises from coffee cups as customers type furiously on laptops.

JANE (28), dressed in business casual, scans the room looking for a seat. She spots one near the window.

JANE
(to barista)
Is that seat taken?

BARISTA
All yours.

Jane settles in, opens her laptop. The screen glows as she begins typing. Her phone BUZZES.

JANE
(answering)
Hello?

VOICE (V.O.)
The package has been delivered.

Jane's face goes pale. She looks around nervously.

JANE
(whispering)
I thought we agreedâ€”

VOICE (V.O.)
Plans change.

The line goes dead. Jane stares at her phone, then quickly packs up her laptop.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Jane bursts through the door, looking over her shoulder. A BLACK SUV idles across the street.

JANE
(to herself)
Not good.

She starts walking quickly down the sidewalk. The SUV's engine RUMBLES to life.

JANE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Pick up, pick up...

FADE TO BLACK.
