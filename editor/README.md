# ScriptAIble Editor

A lightweight React and TypeScript front end for editing Fountain scripts. It provides basic load and save actions and uses the local `fountain-js` parser to preview the structured output.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features

- Open `.fountain` or `.txt` files
- Edit script text directly in the browser
- Save current script to a Fountain file
- Live JSON preview generated by [`fountain-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fountain-js)

This editor is an initial stepping stone toward integrating AI-driven characters and reviewers.
